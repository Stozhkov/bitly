# Hello world!
##This is my study project.

I tried to make a link shortening service similar to bit.ly.

In this project I used Mysql as database and Redis as cache to increase performance.
The project is based on the Django framework
I use DRF as a backend and Vue as a frontend.
Gunicorn and NGINX are used to run the application.

The project is launched in containers. A docker-compose file is configured to run.
